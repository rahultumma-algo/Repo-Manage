# Activity Flow Diagram

This README provides information about the symbols used in activity flow diagrams along with an example diagram.

## Process Flow Diagram Symbols

| Element               | Symbol | Meaning                                                        |
|-----------------------|--------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Process Step          |   □    | Functionality or process step.                                 |
| Start/End Point       |   ○    | Start or end of a process or flow.                             |
| Navigation/Flow       |   →    | Flow direction between steps.                                  |
| Conditional Diamond   |   ◆    | Decision point in the process flow.                            |
| Fork                  |   ┬    | Splitting point for multiple paths.                            |
| Merge                 |   ┴    | Convergence point for multiple paths.                          |
